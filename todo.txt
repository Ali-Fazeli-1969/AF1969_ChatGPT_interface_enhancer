- make the process of updating chats more efficient, like
   instead of sending the entire document body everytime,
   make it so the document body (or just the chat container)
   is sent once at initialization and then new messages are
   added as <article> tags

- instead of mirror tabs being opened on the
   chatgpt website to get the necessary styles,
   make it so the main tab provides everything
   the mirror tab needs

- the send chat function is automatically
   activated when a new <article> is added
   instead of it being either activated using
   a timer, on clicking the send button or
   manually

- make a library file so both the content
   script and background script can access it
   instead of copy and pasting necessary variables

   4.1- name the div element selectors so you know
   	what they actually mean

- the function responsible for hiding
   and unhiding the top bar should
   have a way of differentiating
   between the top bar that's used
   when the window is and isn't maximized

- A mark jump feature where activating it
   causes all main and mirror windows to jump
   to that mark

- in markFunction(), just change event.key to
   eventKey in function argument

- a kind of scrolling functionality where
   "J" and "K" keys are used to jump up and down from
   message to message

- a new format to store main tabs and mirror tabs,
   allowing for the existence of multiple main tabs
   each with their own set of mirror tabs

- convert double quotes to single quotes

- store mirror window ids in an array so they don't get
  	overwritten because it can cause bugs if you create
	mirror windows too fast
