1- make the process of updating chats more efficient, like
	instead of sending the entire document body everytime,
	make it so the document body (or just the chat container)
	is sent once at initialization and then new messages are
	added as <article> tags

2- instead of mirror tabs being opened on the
	chatgpt website to get the necessary styles,
	make it so the main tab provides everything
	the mirror tab needs

3- the send chat function is automatically
	activated when a new <article> is added
	instead of it being either activated using
	a timer, on clicking the send button or
	manually

4- make a library file so both the content
	script and background script can access it
	instead of copy and pasting necessary variables

	4.1- name the div element selectors so you know
		what they actually mean

5- the function responsible for hiding
	and unhiding the top bar should
	have a way of differentiating
	between the top bar that's used
	when the window is and isn't maximized

6- A mark jump feature where activating it
	causes all main and mirror windows to jump
	to that mark

7- in markFunction(), just change event.key to
	eventKey in function argument
